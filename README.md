[**Music Genre Classification**](https://github.com/shreyakabra/MachineLearningProjects/blob/main/MusicGenreClassification.ipynb): 
This project uses machine learning to classify music tracks into genres based on extracted audio features (e.g., MFCCs). The models (SVM, Naive Bayes, Random Forest) are trained and evaluated, achieving up to 85% accuracy. Dimensionality reduction and hyperparameter tuning are applied to optimize performance.
